        "Unit 1: Introduction to Biology,1.1 Definition of Biology,,\"Biology is the scientific study of life or living things. What does it mean to be “alive”? It seems very difficult to objectively define life in a simple sentence. But, we recognize life mainly by common characteristics shared by living systems. Living things are composed of one or more cells, they can grow, reproduce, they transmit genetic information to their offspring, they need the energy to accomplish work, they can maintain relatively constant internal conditions (homeostasis) and they are capable of evolutionary adaptation to the environment etc. What is a scientific study? Biologists study about living things using a scientific method that involves asking questions, suggesting possible answers; and testing for the validity of the answers through experimentation. This scientific study follows the study of structures and processes that we can verify, observe and measure, either directly or indirectly with the help of tools and technology, such as microscopes.\",,\n",
        "Unit 1: Introduction to Biology,1.2 Why do we study Biology?,,\"Human beings have an inborn curiosity about the natural world that leads them to study living organisms and their habitats. Studying biology helps us understand how living things work, how they function and interact with the environment. Biology touches our everyday life in many ways. For example, biologists have discovered drugs that are used to treat different human diseases. Many biologists are working on problems that critically affect our lives, such as understanding how our animals’ and plants’ bodies work, how ecosystems function, how advancements in genetics and cell biology are transforming medicine and agriculture, as well as the use of forensic biology to investigate crime. Furthermore, the study of ecology is helping societies evaluate environmental issues such as global warming, and fermentation science is used to produce alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine. In addition, biological studies are used in treating patients suffering from AIDS, tuberculosis, and some types of cancer.\",,\n",
        "Unit 1: Introduction to Biology,1.3. The Scientific Method,,\"Biology is a science of inquiry. What comes to your mind when you hear the word “science”? Biologists are always curious about why things happen or how things happen. By asking questions and seeking science-based responses known as the scientific method, they come up with new theories to explain new findings. The scientific method involves a series of steps that guide scientists through such scientific investigations. Biologists study the living world by posing questions about it. The general steps of the scientific method are: Observation – scientific study begins with careful observations (often of a problem to solve) that lead to a question. Observations can be made either directly (e.g. using your sense organs) or indirectly using scientific tools such as microscopes. Asking Questions – the observations usually lead the scientist to ask questions (inquiry). Forming a hypothesis – a hypothesis is a proposed scientific explanation (a possible answer) for a set of question(s). To solve a problem, one can propose several hypotheses. Scientific hypotheses should be testable. Testing the hypothesis – a hypothesis can be tested through experimentation. Any scientific experiment must have the ability to be duplicated because the “answer” the scientist comes up with (whether it supports or rejects the original hypothesis) can’t become part of scientific knowledge unless other scientists can perform the same experiment and achieve similar results. If a hypothesis is not supported by experimental data, one can propose a new hypothesis. Drawing conclusions – scientists consider their original hypotheses and ask whether they could still be right in light of the new information gathered during the experiment. If so, the hypotheses can remain as possible explanations for how things work. If not, scientists reject those hypotheses and try to come up with alternate explanations (new hypotheses) that can explain what they’ve observed. Communicating the findings – when scientists complete some work, they write a paper that explains exactly what they did and the results they obtained. Then, they submit the paper to a scientific journal in their field. The findings are published in scientific journals to share with teachers, students, and other researchers. Example of hypothesis testing in everyday life: Suppose you want to use your torch (handheld flashlight) to find a missing pen in your bedroom. When you switch the torch on, it is not working. The following flow chart illustrates hypothesis testing for a torch that doesn’t work.\",,\n",

        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.1 Characteristics of living things,,\"Living things have a variety of shapes and forms. Biologists study life in many different ways. Biologists often live with wildlife, collect fossils, or listen to whales. For example, they may count how many times a hummingbird’s wings beat per second. What makes something “alive”? Anyone could deduce that a galloping horse is alive and a car is not, but why? We cannot say “if it moves, it’s alive” because a car can move, and gelatin can wiggle in a bowl, yet they are certainly not alive. Although we cannot define life with a single sentence, we can list a series of characteristics shared by living systems.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.1 Characteristics of living things,,\"These characteristics include: organization (being made of one or more cells), ability to grow and develop, ability to reproduce, possession of a genetic code (DNA) that is passed to offspring, requirement for energy (metabolism), ability to respond to stimuli, maintenance of internal stability (homeostasis), and capacity to adapt to the environment over time (evolution). All living things exhibit these characteristics to be considered alive.\",,\n",

        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.2 Taxonomy of living things,,\"Taxonomy is the science of classifying living things. It involves grouping organisms into categories based on shared characteristics. This makes it easier for biologists to study and communicate about the diversity of life. The field of taxonomy provides a framework for naming and categorizing species.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.2 Taxonomy of living things,,\"Modern taxonomy is hierarchical. The broadest category is the domain, followed by kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Each level of this hierarchy is called a taxonomic rank. Organisms are classified from general (domain) to very specific (species). For instance, humans belong to domain Eukarya, kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Primates, family Hominidae, genus Homo, and species sapiens.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.2.1 Principles of classification,,\"Classification of living things is based on shared characteristics and evolutionary ancestry. Taxonomists examine features of organisms (morphology, genetics, biochemistry, etc.) to determine relationships. They follow certain principles: organisms within the same group share more characteristics with each other than with those in different groups; classification reflects evolutionary descent; and each species is given a unique scientific name.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.2.2. Taxonomic hierarchies in biological classification,,\"The taxonomic hierarchy arranges organisms into nested groups of increasing specificity. The major ranks are: Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. Each species is placed into this hierarchy. Closely related species are grouped in the same genus; related genera are grouped in a family; and so on up the hierarchy. For example, cats and lions are different species but both belong to the genus Panthera; they also share higher ranks (family Felidae, order Carnivora, etc.).\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.3 Relevance of classification,,\"Classification has practical importance. It helps scientists organize and retrieve information about organisms efficiently. By knowing the classification of an organism, one can infer a lot about its biology (for instance, knowing a species is a mammal tells us it likely has hair and produces milk). Classification also has applications in fields like medicine, agriculture, and conservation. For example, identifying disease-causing organisms correctly is critical for treatment, and classifying pests can help in managing them.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.4 Linnaean system of nomenclature,,\"The Linnaean system of nomenclature is a method of naming species. Developed by Carl Linnaeus, this system assigns every species a two-part scientific name (binomial nomenclature). The first part of the name is the genus and is capitalized; the second part is the species identifier (specific epithet) and is not capitalized. Both parts together uniquely identify the species, and the full name is usually italicized (for example, Homo sapiens). This standardized naming avoids confusion caused by local or common names.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.5 Common Ethiopian animals and plants,,\"Ethiopia is home to a wide range of animals and plants, some of which are endemic (found only in Ethiopia). Common animals include the Ethiopian wolf, gelada baboon, and walia ibex. Common plants include ensete (false banana), coffee (which originated in Ethiopia), and various acacia trees. These organisms are classified into the broader taxonomic categories, but they have special significance in Ethiopia’s ecosystems.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.6 The five-kingdom system of classification,,\"One way to classify life is into five major kingdoms: Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. This five-kingdom system was traditionally used to categorize organisms based on fundamental traits. Monera includes all prokaryotic organisms (like bacteria); Protista includes mostly single-celled eukaryotes; Fungi includes molds, yeasts, mushrooms (organisms with chitin cell walls and absorptive nutrition); Plantae includes multicellular photosynthetic organisms with cellulose cell walls (plants); and Animalia includes multicellular organisms that consume organic material (animals).\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.6.1.

Monerans include bacteria and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). They are extremely diverse and can be found in almost every environment on Earth. They reproduce mostly asexually (binary fission) and have various modes of nutrition (some are photosynthetic, others are chemosynthetic or heterotrophic).\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.6.2. Kingdom Protista,,\"Kingdom Protista includes mostly unicellular eukaryotic organisms (organisms with a nucleus). Protists can be very diverse: this kingdom includes protozoa (animal-like protists, e.g., Amoeba, Paramecium), algae (plant-like protists, e.g., Chlamydomonas, kelp), and slime molds (fungus-like protists). Protists can have various modes of nutrition – some are photosynthetic, others ingest food or absorb nutrients. They often live in aquatic or moist environments.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.6.3. Kingdom Fungi,,\"Kingdom Fungi comprises eukaryotic organisms that have cell walls made of chitin and obtain nutrients via absorption. Fungi are heterotrophs – they release enzymes into the environment to break down organic matter and then absorb the nutrients. This kingdom includes molds, yeasts, and mushrooms. Fungi play crucial roles as decomposers in ecosystems, breaking down dead organic material. Some fungi are beneficial (like yeast used in baking), while others can cause diseases or spoil food.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.6.4. Kingdom Plantae,,\"Kingdom Plantae includes multicellular eukaryotes that are primarily photosynthetic (they use sunlight to produce food from CO₂ and water). Plants have cell walls made of cellulose. This kingdom ranges from mosses and ferns to flowering plants and trees. Plants are essential for life on Earth: they produce oxygen and form the base of most food chains. In Ethiopia, examples include indigenous plants like the Abyssinian rose and diverse highland forest trees.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.6.5 Kingdom Animalia,,\"Kingdom Animalia comprises multicellular eukaryotic organisms that are mostly motile and obtain nutrients by consumption (heterotrophs). Animals do not have cell walls. This kingdom is incredibly diverse, including everything from sponges and insects to fish, birds, and mammals. Animals typically have complex organ systems and most reproduce sexually. Ethiopia’s fauna (animal life) includes unique species such as the gelada (a monkey found only in the Ethiopian highlands) and various antelope species like the kudu and oryx.\",,\n",
        "Unit 2: Characteristics and Classification of Organisms,2.7 Renowned taxonomists in Ethiopia,,\"Ethiopia has produced notable scientists in the field of taxonomy and biodiversity. Renowned Ethiopian taxonomists have contributed to discovering and classifying the country’s rich flora and fauna. For example, scientists have catalogued numerous endemic plant species in Ethiopia’s diverse ecosystems and have worked on classifying agricultural crops and medicinal plants. These taxonomists’ work is important for conservation and sustainable use of biological resources.\",,\n",

        "Unit 3: Cells,3.1. What is a cell?,,\"The cell is the smallest and most basic unit of living things. All living organisms are composed of cells. Some organisms are unicellular (made of a single cell), while others are multicellular (made of many cells specialized for different functions). Cells carry out the essential processes that characterize life. For instance, cells take in nutrients, convert these to energy, carry out specialized functions, and reproduce to make new cells.\",,\n",
        "Unit 3: Cells,3.1. What is a cell?,,\"Cells vary in size and shape depending on their function and the organism they belong to, but despite differences, all cells share certain common structures and components. For example, every cell is bounded by a plasma membrane that controls what enters or leaves. All cells contain DNA as genetic material (though in prokaryotes it’s not enclosed in a nucleus). Understanding cells is fundamental to biology because processes at the cellular level underpin the function of tissues, organs, and entire organisms.\",,\n",
        "Unit 3: Cells,3.2. Cell theory,,\"The cell theory is a foundational principle of biology that has three main tenets: (1) All living things are composed of one or more cells. (2) The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms. (3) All cells arise from pre-existing cells (by cell division). This theory emerged in the 19th century from the work of scientists like Matthias Schleiden, Theodor Schwann, and Rudolf Virchow. It emphasizes the importance of cells in the structure of life and the continuity of life through cell division.\",,\n",
        "Unit 3: Cells,3.2. Cell theory,,\"An implication of the cell theory is that studying cells can give insights into the functions and processes of entire organisms. It also highlights that any disruption at the cellular level can affect the whole organism (for example, diseases often begin with changes in cells). The theory set the stage for modern cellular biology, including understanding how organisms grow, heal, and reproduce.\",,\n",
        "Unit 3: Cells,3.3. Cell structure and function,,\"Cells have various structures (organelles) that carry out specific functions, especially in eukaryotic cells. For instance, the nucleus stores genetic information (DNA) and controls the cell’s activities. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell; they produce energy (ATP) through respiration. Chloroplasts (in plant cells) capture light energy for photosynthesis. The endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus synthesize, modify, and transport proteins and lipids. Each structure within a cell contributes to the cell’s survival and function.\",,\n",
        "Unit 3: Cells,3.3. Cell structure and function,,\"The cell membrane (plasma membrane) is another critical structure – it protects the cell and regulates what enters and exits. In plant cells, a rigid cell wall surrounds the membrane, providing support. Cells also contain ribosomes (sites of protein synthesis), lysosomes (in animal cells, containing enzymes to break down waste), and the cytoskeleton (a network of fibers that helps maintain cell shape and aids in movement). The interplay of all these parts allows the cell to operate as a living unit.\",,\n",
        "Unit 3: Cells,3.4 Types of cells,,\"There are two fundamental types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells (found in bacteria and archaea) do not have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. Their DNA is in a region called the nucleoid. They are generally smaller and simpler in structure. Eukaryotic cells (found in protists, fungi, plants, and animals) have a nucleus that contains their DNA and various organelles. Eukaryotic cells are typically larger and more complex. Additionally, within multicellular organisms, cells can be specialized into different types (like muscle cells, nerve cells, blood cells), each adapted to specific functions.\",,\n",
        "Unit 3: Cells,3.4 Types of cells,,\"For example, plant cells (a type of eukaryotic cell) have chloroplasts for photosynthesis and a cell wall for structure, which animal cells lack. Animal cells have centrioles involved in cell division, which plant cells do not have. Bacterial cells (prokaryotes) might have structures like flagella for movement or plasmids (small circular DNA), which are different from eukaryotic cell structures. Understanding the types of cells and their differences is crucial for fields ranging from medicine to evolutionary biology.\",,\n",

        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.1 Introduction to reproduction,,\"Reproduction is the biological process by which new individual organisms (offspring) are produced from their parents. It is a fundamental characteristic of living things, ensuring the continuation of a species. There are two main modes of reproduction: asexual and sexual. In asexual reproduction, a single organism can reproduce without the involvement of another; the offspring are usually genetic copies (clones) of the parent. In sexual reproduction, two parents contribute genetic material to produce offspring with genetic variation.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.1 Introduction to reproduction,,\"Reproduction is essential not only for multiplication of organisms but also for the passing on of genetic traits from one generation to the next. It is closely tied to evolution – sexual reproduction in particular introduces genetic variation among offspring, which can be acted upon by natural selection. The study of reproduction also has practical importance in fields like agriculture (breeding of crops and livestock) and medicine (understanding human reproductive health).\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.2 Asexual reproduction,,\"Asexual reproduction involves only one parent and does not involve the fusion of gametes (sex cells). The offspring are genetically very similar to the parent (barring mutations). Common forms of asexual reproduction include binary fission (as in bacteria, where the cell splits into two), budding (as in yeast or hydra, where a new individual grows from a certain region of the parent), spore formation (as in fungi and some plants like ferns), and vegetative propagation (in plants, where new plants grow from parts like stems, roots, etc.).\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.2 Asexual reproduction,,\"Because asexual reproduction produces clones, it is efficient and can rapidly increase population size, but it doesn’t generate genetic diversity in the offspring. In stable environments, this can be advantageous; however, in changing environments, lack of diversity can be a disadvantage. Many organisms that reproduce asexually can also have sexual phases or mechanisms to occasionally increase genetic variation.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.3 Types of asexual reproduction,,\"There are various specific types of asexual reproduction observed in organisms: Fission (splitting of a single organism into two or more individuals of equal size, seen in bacteria and protozoa), Budding (seen in yeast and hydra, where the new organism grows as a bud on the parent and then detaches), Fragmentation (where a parent organism breaks into fragments, each capable of growing into a new organism, e.g. starfish and certain worms), and Spore formation (organisms like fungi and some algae produce spores that can grow into new individuals). Vegetative propagation in plants (like runners in strawberry plants, tubers in potatoes) is another form.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.3.1 Fission,,\"Fission is a simple form of asexual reproduction where an organism divides to form two (binary fission) or multiple (multiple fission) offspring. In binary fission, which is common in bacteria and protists, the DNA is replicated and the cell splits into two roughly equal parts, each receiving a copy of the DNA. Multiple fission, seen in some protists like plasmodium (malaria parasite), involves the cell dividing into many daughter cells simultaneously. Fission allows for rapid population increase under favorable conditions.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.3.2 Budding,,\"Budding is a form of asexual reproduction where a new individual develops from some generative anatomical point of the parent organism. In organisms like the hydra (a simple freshwater animal), a bud forms on the side of the body due to repeated cell division at that site. The bud grows into a miniature hydra and then detaches to live independently. In yeast (a unicellular fungus), budding occurs when a small outgrowth (bud) forms on the parent cell, the nucleus divides, and one nucleus moves into the bud, which eventually separates. Budding results in offspring that are initially smaller than the parent but grow to full size.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.3.3 Spore formation,,\"Spore formation is an asexual reproductive strategy used by many organisms such as fungi, algae, and some plants (ferns, mosses). The organism produces spores, which are usually single cells protected by a hard coating. Spores can often withstand harsh conditions (dryness, extreme temperature) and remain dormant until conditions are favorable. When conditions allow, a spore germinates and grows into a new organism. For example, bread mold (Rhizopus) produces spores in sporangia; when the sporangium bursts, spores are released and can develop into new mold if they land on suitable substrate.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.3.4 Fragmentation,,\"Fragmentation is an asexual reproduction method where an organism’s body breaks into two or more parts, and each part regenerates into a complete organism. This is seen in some simple animals and many plants. For example, certain annelid worms (like planarians) and starfish can form new individuals from fragments. If a starfish is cut into pieces and each piece contains part of the central disc, each piece can regrow missing parts and become a whole starfish. In plants, fragmentation is common when parts like leaves or stems take root and grow (like a leaf cutting of a succulent growing into a new plant).\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.3.5 Vegetative propagation,,\"Vegetative propagation is a form of asexual reproduction in plants where new independent plants grow from parts of the parent plant (such as stems, roots, or leaves) rather than from seeds. Examples include runners (stolons) in strawberries, tubers in potatoes, bulbs in tulips or onions, and cuttings (like a piece of stem or leaf that can grow roots). Farmers and horticulturists often use vegetative propagation techniques (like grafting, cuttings, layering) to produce crops that retain desirable characteristics of the parent plant.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.4 Sexual reproduction,,\"Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of specialized sex cells called gametes. Typically, a male gamete (sperm) fuses with a female gamete (egg or ovum) in a process called fertilization, forming a zygote that develops into a new individual. This type of reproduction requires two parents (except in organisms that can self-fertilize, like some plants and hermaphroditic animals), and the offspring inherit a combination of genetic material from both parents. This genetic mixing results in variation among offspring.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.4 Sexual reproduction,,\"The key stages in sexual reproduction include gamete formation (through meiosis, which halves the chromosome number), mating/fertilization (bringing gametes together and fusing them), and development of the zygote into a new organism (through cell division and differentiation). Sexual reproduction is more complex and usually slower than asexual reproduction, but its advantage lies in generating genetic diversity, which can be beneficial for the survival of a species in changing environments.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.5 Sexual reproduction in flowering plants,,\"Flowering plants (angiosperms) reproduce sexually through their flowers. Flowers contain the reproductive organs: stamens (male part) produce pollen grains (male gametes) in the anthers, and carpels (female part, often called pistils) contain ovules (female gametes) in the ovary. Pollination is the transfer of pollen from anthers to the stigma (top of the pistil). This can occur via wind, water, or pollinators (like bees, birds). Once pollen reaches a compatible stigma, it germinates, growing a pollen tube down into the ovary to deliver sperm cells to an ovule. Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell fuses with the egg cell in the ovule, forming a zygote.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.5 Sexual reproduction in flowering plants,,\"After fertilization, the zygote develops into an embryo within the seed. The ovule becomes the seed (containing the embryo and a food supply), and the ovary typically develops into a fruit, which aids in seed protection and dispersal. When conditions are right, the seed germinates and grows into a new plant. Flowering plants have developed various strategies to promote cross-pollination (between different plants) to increase genetic diversity, such as colorful petals and nectar to attract animals or timing mechanisms to avoid self-pollination.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.6 Sexual reproduction in humans,,\"Human reproduction is sexual and involves the male and female reproductive systems. Males produce sperm in the testes (male gonads) and deliver them through the reproductive tract (epididymis, vas deferens, urethra, and penis). Females produce eggs (ova) in the ovaries (female gonads). Typically, once a month, an ovary releases an egg (ovulation), which travels through the fallopian tube toward the uterus. Sexual intercourse can deposit sperm in the female reproductive tract; sperm may then swim through the cervix and uterus into the fallopian tubes where fertilization can occur if an egg is present.\",,\n",
        "Unit 4: Reproduction,4.6 Sexual reproduction in humans,,\"When a sperm cell fertilizes the egg, a zygote forms, which begins to divide and develop as it moves to the uterus. The developing embryo implants in the uterine wall and continues to grow into a fetus over about nine months (gestation). The mother’s body provides nutrients and oxygen to the fetus via the placenta. Eventually, childbirth occurs and the baby is born. Key hormones regulate these processes (for example, hormones control the menstrual cycle, ovulation, and changes during pregnancy). Human reproduction also involves behaviors, reproductive health, and sometimes medical interventions (like fertility treatments).\",,\n",

        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.1: What is food?,,\"Food is any substance (usually composed of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals) that organisms consume to obtain the nutrients and energy required for growth, maintenance, and vital processes. In the context of human biology, food comes from plants and animals and includes everything we eat or drink that nourishes our bodies. Food provides energy (usually measured in calories) and building materials for the body’s cells, and certain food components are essential because the body cannot synthesize them (like some amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals).\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.1: What is food?,,\"Beyond providing nutrition, food also often has cultural, social, and psychological dimensions. Different cultures have diverse diets and cuisines, and food plays a role in social gatherings and traditions. However, fundamentally, food’s biological purpose is to sustain life. A balanced diet containing the right proportions of different nutrients is crucial for maintaining health, supporting growth, and preventing diseases related to malnutrition or overnutrition (such as deficiencies or obesity).\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.2 Nutrients and their sources,,\"Nutrients are the components in foods that organisms use to survive and grow. The major nutrient groups for humans include carbohydrates, proteins, fats (lipids), vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates (found in foods like grains, fruits, and vegetables) are a primary energy source. Proteins (in meat, legumes, dairy) provide amino acids for building and repairing tissues. Fats (in oils, butter, nuts) are a concentrated energy source and are necessary for cell membranes and hormone production.\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.2 Nutrients and their sources,,\"Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients: vitamins (like Vitamin C from citrus fruits, Vitamin D from fish or sunlight exposure) and minerals (like calcium from milk, iron from leafy greens or meat) are needed in smaller quantities but are essential for various body functions, such as enzyme reactions, bone formation, oxygen transport, etc. Water is also a vital nutrient – it makes up a significant portion of the body and is involved in nearly every bodily function. Different foods are rich in different nutrients, which is why a varied diet is important.\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.3 The digestive system,,\"The digestive system is responsible for breaking down food into smaller components (nutrients) that can be absorbed into the bloodstream and utilized by the body. It consists of the digestive tract (mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine) and accessory organs (salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, pancreas). Digestion begins in the mouth where food is chewed and mixed with saliva (which contains enzymes). The chewed food (bolus) travels down the esophagus to the stomach, where gastric juices (acid and enzymes) further break down proteins and churn food into a semi-liquid (chyme).\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.3 The digestive system,,\"Chyme then moves into the small intestine, which is the main site for digestion and absorption. The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine to break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, while the liver produces bile (stored in the gallbladder) which helps emulsify fats for digestion. Nutrients (like glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals) are absorbed through the intestinal walls into the blood (or lymph for fats). The remaining indigestible material passes into the large intestine, where water is reabsorbed and gut bacteria further act on the material, producing vitamins like Vitamin K. Finally, waste is excreted through the rectum and anus as feces.\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.4 Nutrient absorption and transport,,\"After digestion breaks foods into nutrients, absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine. The inner surface of the small intestine has many folds, villi, and microvilli, which greatly increase the surface area for absorption. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars (like glucose), proteins into amino acids, and fats into fatty acids and glycerol. These pass through the cells of the intestinal lining. Water-soluble nutrients (sugars, amino acids, many vitamins, minerals) enter the bloodstream directly and are carried first to the liver via the hepatic portal vein. The liver can then process these nutrients (storing some, releasing others, detoxifying substances).\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.4 Nutrient absorption and transport,,\"Fat-soluble nutrients (fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K) are absorbed into the lymphatic system via small vessels called lacteals in the villi. These nutrients eventually enter the bloodstream near the heart (via the thoracic duct). The circulatory system transports absorbed nutrients to cells throughout the body. Cells take up nutrients from the blood for metabolism, growth, and repair. The efficiency of absorption can be affected by factors such as the health of the intestinal tract, presence of certain digestive enzymes, and interactions between nutrients (for example, Vitamin C enhances iron absorption).\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.5 Balanced diet and malnutrition,,\"A balanced diet provides all the necessary nutrients in the correct proportions to maintain health and proper function of the body. It typically includes a mix of carbohydrates (for energy), proteins (for growth and repair), fats (for energy and cell functions), vitamins and minerals (for various metabolic processes), and adequate water. Eating a variety of foods—grains, fruits, vegetables, protein sources, dairy or alternatives, and healthy fats—helps ensure balance. Malnutrition occurs when the diet is not balanced. It can be undernutrition (not getting enough calories or specific nutrients) or overnutrition (excess intake of certain nutrients or calories leading to obesity).\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.5 Balanced diet and malnutrition,,\"Undernutrition can result in deficiencies that cause health problems: for instance, lack of protein can cause kwashiorkor, insufficient calories cause marasmus, lack of Vitamin C causes scurvy, lack of Vitamin D causes rickets, iron deficiency causes anemia, etc. Overnutrition and imbalanced diets can lead to issues like obesity, cardiovascular diseases (from excess saturated fats/cholesterol), type 2 diabetes (from excessive sugar intake and obesity), or hypertension (excess salt intake). Therefore, maintaining a balanced diet is crucial for preventing malnutrition in all its forms and for supporting overall health.\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.6 Foodborne diseases,,\"Foodborne diseases (food poisoning) are illnesses resulting from the consumption of contaminated food or beverages. They can be caused by pathogens like bacteria (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria), viruses (e.g., norovirus, hepatitis A), parasites, or by toxins and chemicals. Symptoms often include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. The severity can range from mild discomfort to severe illness or even death, especially in vulnerable populations (infants, elderly, immunocompromised).\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.6 Foodborne diseases,,\"Common causes of food contamination include improper handling, inadequate cooking, poor refrigeration, cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods, and consumption of food past its safe date. Preventative measures include practicing good hygiene (like washing hands and surfaces often), cooking foods to safe temperatures, refrigerating perishables promptly, and avoiding foods from unsafe sources. Public health systems also monitor outbreaks of foodborne illness to identify sources and prevent widespread exposure.\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.7 Hygiene and sanitation,,\"Hygiene and sanitation are critical for preventing diseases, especially those that are foodborne or waterborne. Personal hygiene includes practices like washing hands with soap (especially after using the toilet and before handling food), bathing regularly, and keeping clothes clean. Food hygiene involves cleaning fruits and vegetables, safely handling raw meat (to avoid cross-contamination), cooking food thoroughly, and storing it properly. In a community, sanitation refers to the systems for safe disposal of human waste, garbage, and maintaining clean water supplies.\",,\n",
        "Unit 5: Food, Nutrition, and Health,5.7 Hygiene and sanitation,,\"Poor sanitation and hygiene can lead to contamination of water and food with pathogens. Diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and many parasitic infections are linked to fecal contamination of water or food. Ensuring clean latrines/toilets, proper sewage systems, and clean drinking water can dramatically reduce these diseases. On an individual level, educating people about hygiene (like the importance of handwashing and safe food practices) is one of the most effective ways to improve public health.\",,\n",

        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.1 Basic concepts of ecology,,\"Ecology is the branch of biology that studies how organisms interact with each other and with their environment. Basic concepts in ecology include populations (groups of individuals of the same species in a given area), communities (all the different species in an area), ecosystems (the community plus the physical environment), and the biosphere (the global sum of all ecosystems). Ecology examines relationships like predation, competition, and symbiosis among organisms, as well as how energy flows and nutrients cycle through ecosystems.\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.1 Basic concepts of ecology,,\"An important concept is the habitat (the physical place where an organism lives) and niche (the role an organism plays in its ecosystem, including what it eats, how it behaves, etc.). Ecologists also study how ecosystems function (for example, producers like plants capture energy from the sun, consumers eat other organisms, and decomposers break down dead matter, returning nutrients to the soil). Understanding ecology is crucial for conservation efforts and for addressing environmental issues like climate change, pollution, and resource management.\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.2 Ecological relationships,,\"Organisms in an ecosystem interact in various ways. Predation is a relationship where one organism (predator) kills and eats another (prey). Competition occurs when organisms vie for the same resources (food, space, light, mates); this can be within a species or between different species. Symbiotic relationships are close interactions between different species: mutualism (both benefit, e.g., bees pollinating flowers), commensalism (one benefits, the other is neither harmed nor helped, e.g., barnacles on a whale), and parasitism (one benefits at the expense of the other, e.g., ticks feeding on a host).\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.2 Ecological relationships,,\"These relationships influence the population dynamics and structure of communities. For example, predation can control prey populations (and vice versa if prey availability controls predator numbers). Competition can cause competitive exclusion (one species outcompetes another) or niche differentiation (species evolve to utilize resources differently to reduce competition). Symbiotic relationships can be essential for survival – like certain gut bacteria aiding in digestion for humans. Ecologists study these relationships to understand how ecosystems remain balanced or how they change over time.\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.3 Flow of energy in ecosystems,,\"Energy in ecosystems flows from the sun to producers and then to consumers. Green plants, algae, and some bacteria are producers (autotrophs) that capture solar energy through photosynthesis, converting it into chemical energy (glucose). This energy is then passed on to consumers (heterotrophs) when they eat the producers. Primary consumers (herbivores) eat producers; secondary consumers (carnivores or omnivores) eat primary consumers; tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers; and so on. This creates a food chain, and interconnected food chains form a food web.\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.3 Flow of energy in ecosystems,,\"At each step (trophic level) in a food chain, energy is lost mostly as heat due to metabolic processes (following the second law of thermodynamics). Typically only about 10% of the energy at one trophic level is passed to the next level; this is why ecosystems have more biomass at lower levels (lots of plants, fewer top predators). Decomposers (like bacteria and fungi) play a crucial role by breaking down dead organisms and waste, releasing nutrients back into the environment and making them available again to producers. The flow of energy is one-way (sun → producers → consumers → decomposers), whereas nutrients cycle through ecosystems.\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.4 Cycling of matter in ecosystems,,\"Matter (nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, water, phosphorus) cycles through ecosystems in biogeochemical cycles. In the carbon cycle, carbon dioxide is taken from the atmosphere by plants during photosynthesis and converted into organic matter. Carbon moves through food webs as organisms eat and are eaten. It is returned to the atmosphere as CO₂ through respiration, decomposition, and combustion (burning of wood or fossil fuels). The nitrogen cycle involves bacteria that convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by plants (nitrogen fixation), then it moves through food chains and is eventually returned to the atmosphere by other bacteria (denitrification).\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.4 Cycling of matter in ecosystems,,\"The water cycle describes how water evaporates from surfaces (or transpires from plants), condenses into clouds, and falls as precipitation, then runs off or infiltrates into ground, eventually returning to oceans. The phosphorus cycle involves the weathering of rocks that release phosphate, which plants absorb; it moves through the food chain and is returned to the soil through decomposition. Unlike energy, which flows through, matter is recycled within ecosystems. Disruption in these cycles (like excess carbon from fossil fuels or excess nitrogen from fertilizers) can lead to environmental issues like climate change and eutrophication.\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.5 Population dynamics,,\"Population dynamics involves studying how and why the number of individuals in a population changes over time. Key factors include birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration. An important concept is carrying capacity – the maximum population size that an environment can sustain indefinitely given the resources available (food, habitat, water, etc.). When a population is below carrying capacity, it may grow (often in an exponential fashion if resources are abundant). As it nears carrying capacity, growth typically slows and levels off (logistic growth) due to limiting factors like resource scarcity, predation, disease, or competition.\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.5 Population dynamics,,\"Populations can experience various types of fluctuations: some grow quickly and crash (boom-and-bust cycles), others tend to stabilize, and some oscillate (like predator-prey cycles where prey increase leads to predator increase which then reduces prey, causing predator numbers to fall, and so on). Human activities can also affect population dynamics (for instance, introducing or removing species, habitat destruction, or conservation efforts). Understanding population dynamics is crucial for wildlife management, conservation biology, and studying human impacts on ecosystems.\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.6 Environmental conservation,,\"Environmental conservation involves protecting ecosystems and natural resources to maintain biodiversity and sustain the health of the planet. It covers a range of activities and principles, including wildlife conservation (protecting species from extinction), habitat preservation (maintaining forests, wetlands, etc.), sustainable resource use (using water, soil, timber, fisheries in ways that don’t deplete them), and pollution reduction. Conservation recognizes that human well-being is linked to environmental health; for instance, intact ecosystems provide services like clean water, pollination of crops, climate regulation, and cultural value.\",,\n",
        "Unit 6: Ecology,6.6 Environmental conservation,,\"In Ethiopia, as in other countries, conservation might focus on protecting endemic species (those found only in Ethiopia, like the Ethiopian wolf or Walia ibex) and critical habitats (like highland areas, forests, and national parks). Efforts can include establishing protected areas, reforestation projects, soil conservation on farmlands, and public education about the importance of biodiversity. Challenges to conservation include deforestation, overgrazing, climate change, and human population pressures. Successful conservation often requires balancing human needs with environmental protection through sustainable development.\",,\n",
